Hi guys!!

Here there are some instructions to use the benchmark executer.

- The class that extends the class "AbstractAgent" has to be of type "VacuumAgent1" and it also has to stay in the package "agent".
- Put the agents .jar files in the directory "jars"
- Put your external libraries (if you have some) in the directory "lib/AgentsLibs" and link them in the build path of the benchmark executer project
- Put your xml instances in the directory "xml"
- The conf.txt file contains the maximum execution time permitted for each instance execution expressed in milliseconds
- The benchmark results will be stored in the directory "PerformanceMeasures" in a .csv file.
